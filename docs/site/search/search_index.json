Installing MkDocs Before installing MkDocs , you need to make sure you have Python and pip \u2013 the Python package manager \u2013 up and running. You can verify if you're already good to go with the following commands: python --version # Python 2.7.13 pip --version # pip 9.0.1 Installing and verifying MkDocs is as simple as: pip install mkdocs && mkdocs --version # mkdocs, version 0.16.0 MkDocs version requirements Material requires MkDocs >= 0.16. Furthermore, it is highly recommended to install Pygments and the PyMdown Extensions to get the most out of the Material theme: pip install pygments pip install pymdown-extensions Installing Material using pip Material can be installed with pip : pip install mkdocs-material using choco If you're on Windows you can use Chocolatey to install Material : choco install mkdocs-material This will also install all required dependencies like Python and MkDocs . cloning from GitHub Material can also be used without a system-wide installation by cloning the repository into a subfolder of your project's root directory: git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material.git This is especially useful if you want to extend the theme and override some parts of the theme. The theme will reside in the folder mkdocs-material/material . Troubleshooting Installation on macOS When you're running the pre-installed version of Python on macOS, pip tries to install packages in a folder for which your user might not have the adequate permissions. There are two possible solutions for this: Installing in user space (recommended): Provide the --user flag to the install command and pip will install the package in a user-site location. This is the recommended way. Switching to a homebrewed Python : Upgrade your Python installation to a self-contained solution by installing Python with Homebrew. This should eliminate a lot of problems you may be having with pip . Error: unrecognized theme 'material' If you run into this error, the most common reason is that you installed MkDocs through some package manager (e.g. Homebrew or apt-get ) and the Material theme through pip , so both packages end up in different locations. MkDocs only checks it's install location for themes. Usage In order to enable the Material theme just add one of the following lines to your mkdocs.yml . If you installed Material using pip: theme : 'material' If you cloned Material from GitHub: theme_dir : 'mkdocs-material/material' MkDocs includes a development server, so you can review your changes as you go. The development server can be started with the following command: mkdocs serve Now you can point your browser to localhost:8000 and the Material theme should be visible. From here on, you can start writing your documentation, or read on and customize the theme through some options. Options The Material theme adds some extra variables for configuration via your project's mkdocs.yml . See the following sections for all available options. Changing the color palette Material defines a default hue for every primary and accent color on Google's Material Design color palette . This makes it very easy to change the overall look of the theme. Just set the primary and accent colors using the following variables in your mkdocs.yml : extra : palette : primary : 'indigo' accent : 'light blue' Color names are case-insensitive, but must match the names of the Material Design color palette. Valid values are: red , pink , purple , deep purple , indigo , blue , light blue , cyan , teal , green , light green , lime , yellow , amber , orange , deep orange , brown , grey and blue grey . The last three colors can only be used as a primary color. If the color is set via this configuration, an additional CSS file that defines the color palette is included. If you want to keep things lean, clone the repository and recompile the theme with your custom colors set. See the guide on customization for more information. Primary colors Click on a tile to change the primary color of the theme: Red Pink Purple Deep Purple Indigo Blue Light Blue Cyan Teal Green Light Green Lime Yellow Amber Orange Deep Orange Brown Grey Blue Grey var buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button[data-md-color-primary]\"); Array.prototype.forEach.call(buttons, function(button) { button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() { document.body.dataset.mdColorPrimary = this.dataset.mdColorPrimary; }) }) Accent colors Click on a tile to change the accent color of the theme: Red Pink Purple Deep Purple Indigo Blue Light Blue Cyan Teal Green Light Green Lime Yellow Amber Orange Deep Orange var buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button[data-md-color-accent]\"); Array.prototype.forEach.call(buttons, function(button) { button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() { document.body.dataset.mdColorAccent = this.dataset.mdColorAccent; }) }) Changing the font family Material uses the Roboto font family by default, specifically the regular sans-serif type for text and the monospaced type for code. Both fonts are loaded from Google Fonts and can easily be changed to other fonts, like for example the Ubuntu font family : extra : font : text : 'Ubuntu' code : 'Ubuntu Mono' The text font will be loaded in font-weights 400 and 700 , the monospaced font in regular weight. If you want to load fonts from other destinations or don't want to use the Google Fonts loading magic, just set font to false : extra : font : false Adding a source repository To include a link to the repository of your project within your documentation, set the following variables via your project's mkdocs.yml : repo_name : 'my-github-handle/my-project' repo_url : 'https://github.com/my-github-handle/my-project' Material will render the name of the repository next to the search bar on big screens and as part of the main navigation drawer on smaller screen sizes. Furthermore, if repo_url points to a GitHub, BitBucket or GitLab repository, the respective service logo will be shown next to the name of the repository. Additionally, for GitHub, the number of stars and forks is shown. Why is there an edit button at the top of every article? If the repo_url is set to a GitHub or BitBucket repository, and the repo_name is set to GitHub or BitBucket (implied by default), an edit button will appear at the top of every article. This is the automatic behavior that MkDocs implements. See the MkDocs documentation on more guidance regarding the edit_uri attribute, which defines whether the edit button is shown or not. Adding a logo Material makes it easy to add your logo. Your logo should have rectangular shape with a minimum resolution of 128x128, leave some room towards the edges and be composed of high contrast areas on a transparent ground, as it will be placed on the colored header bar and drawer. Simply create the folder docs/images , add your logo and embed it with: extra : logo : 'images/logo.svg' Adding social links If you want to link your social accounts, the Material theme provides an easy way for doing this in the footer of the documentation using the automatically included FontAwesome webfont. The syntax is simple \u2013 the type must denote the name of the social service, e.g. github , twitter or linkedin and the link must contain the URL you want to link to: extra : social : - type : 'github' link : 'https://github.com/squidfunk' - type : 'twitter' link : 'https://twitter.com/squidfunk' - type : 'linkedin' link : 'https://de.linkedin.com/in/martin-donath-20a95039' The links are generated in order and the type of the links must match the name of the FontAwesome glyph. The fa is automatically added, so github will result in fa fa-github . Google Analytics integration MkDocs makes it easy to integrate site tracking with Google Analytics. Besides basic tracking, clicks on all outgoing links can be tracked as well as how site search is used. Tracking can be activated in your project's mkdocs.yml : google_analytics : - 'UA-XXXXXXXX-X' - 'auto' Disqus integation Material for MkDocs is integrated with Disqus , so if you want to add a comments section to your documentation set the shortname of your Disqus project in your mkdocs.yml : extra : disqus : 'your-disqus-shortname' A new entry at the bottom of the table of contents is generated that is linking to the comments section. The necessary JavaScript is automatically included. Localization Material for MkDocs supports internationalization (i18n). In order to translate the labels (e.g. Previous and Next in the footer), you can override the file partials/language.html and provide your own translations inside the macro t : {% macro t ( key ) %}{{ { \"language\" : \"en\" , \"edit.link.title\" : \"Edit this page\" , \"footer.previous\" : \"Previous\" , \"footer.next\" : \"Next\" , \"meta.comments\" : \"Comments\" , \"meta.source\" : \"Source\" , \"search.placeholder\" : \"Search\" , \"search.result.placeholder\" : \"Type to start searching\" , \"search.result.none\" : \"No matching documents\" , \"search.result.one\" : \"1 matching document\" , \"search.result.other\" : \"# matching documents\" , \"source.link.title\" : \"Go to repository\" , \"toc.title\" : \"Table of contents\" }[ key ] }}{% endmacro %} Just copy the file from the original theme and make your adjustments. See the section on overriding partials and the general guide on theme extension in the customization guide. Tabs From version 1.1.0 on, Material supports another layer on top of the main navigation for larger screens in the form of tabs. This is especially useful for larger documentation projects with a few top-level sections. Tabs can be enabled by setting the respective feature flag to true: extra : feature : tabs : true More advanced customization If you want to change the general appearance of the Material theme, see this article for more information on advanced customization. Extensions MkDocs supports several Markdown extensions . The following extensions are not enabled by default (see the link for which are enabled by default) but highly recommended, so they should be switched on at all times: markdown_extensions : - admonition - codehilite(guess_lang=false) - toc(permalink=true) For more information, see the following list of extensions supported by the Material theme including more information regarding installation and usage: Admonition Codehilite Footnotes Metadata Permalinks PyMdown Extensions Full example Below is a full example configuration for a mkdocs.yml : # Project information site_name : 'My Project' site_description : 'A short description of my project' site_author : 'John Doe' site_url : 'https://my-github-handle.github.io/my-project' # Repository repo_name : 'my-github-handle/my-project' repo_url : 'https://github.com/my-github-handle/my-project' # Copyright copyright : 'Copyright &copy; 2016 - 2017 John Doe' # Documentation and theme theme : 'material' # Options extra : logo : 'images/logo.svg' palette : primary : 'indigo' accent : 'indigo' font : text : 'Roboto' code : 'Roboto Mono' social : - type : 'github' link : 'https://github.com/john-doe' - type : 'twitter' link : 'https://twitter.com/jonh-doe' - type : 'linkedin' link : 'https://de.linkedin.com/in/john-doe' # Google Analytics google_analytics : - 'UA-XXXXXXXX-X' - 'auto' # Extensions markdown_extensions : - admonition - codehilite(guess_lang=false) - toc(permalink=true)","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"material-getting-started/#getting-started","text":"","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"material-getting-started/#installation","text":"Set up Material using Docker The official Docker image for Material comes with all dependencies pre-installed and ready-to-use with the latest version published on PyPI, packaged in a very small image (28MB compressed).","title":"Installation"},{"location":"material-getting-started/#installing-mkdocs","text":"Before installing MkDocs , you need to make sure you have Python and pip \u2013 the Python package manager \u2013 up and running.

Installation Add the following lines to your mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - admonition Usage Admonition blocks follow a simple syntax: every block is started with !!! , followed by a single keyword which is used as the type qualifier of the block. The content of the block then follows on the next line, indented by four spaces. Example: !!! note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result: Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Changing the title By default, the block title will equal the type qualifier in titlecase. However, it can easily be changed by adding a quoted string after the type qualifier. Example: !!! note \"Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result: Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Removing the title Similar to setting a custom title , the icon and title can be omitted by providing an empty string after the type qualifier: Example: !!! note \"\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Embedded code blocks Blocks can contain all kinds of text content, including headlines, lists, paragraphs and other blocks \u2013 except code blocks, because the parser from the standard Markdown library does not account for those. However, the PyMdown Extensions package adds an extension called SuperFences , which makes it possible to nest code blocks within other blocks. Example: Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. SELECT Employees . EmployeeID , Employees . Name , Employees . Salary , Manager . Name AS Manager FROM Employees LEFT JOIN Employees AS Manager ON Employees . ManagerID = Manager . EmployeeID WHERE Employees . EmployeeID = '087652' ; Nunc eu odio eleifend, blandit leo a, volutpat sapien. Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus. Nullam sit amet tincidunt ipsum, sit amet elementum turpis. Etiam ipsum quam, mattis in purus vitae, lacinia fermentum enim. Types Admonition supports user-defined type qualifiers which may influence the style of the inserted block. Following is a list of type qualifiers supported by the Material theme, whereas the default type, and thus fallback for unknown type qualifiers, is note .

The highlighting process is executed during compilation of the Markdown file. Syntax highlighting not working? Please ensure that Pygments is installed. See the next section for further directions on how to set up Pygments or use the official Docker image with all dependencies pre-installed. Installation CodeHilite parses code blocks and wraps them in pre tags. If Pygments is installed, which is a generic syntax highlighter with support for over 300 languages , CodeHilite will also highlight the code block. Pygments can be installed with the following command: pip install pygments To enable CodeHilite, add the following lines to your mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - codehilite Migrating from Material 0.2.x In 0.2.x the CodeHilite extension was included with codehilite(css_class=code) which switched the CSS class from .codehilite to .code . The current version of the theme doesn't require that and defines styles for the default .codehilite class, so the part css_class=code needs to be removed. Usage Specifying the language The CodeHilite extension uses the same syntax as regular Markdown code blocks, but needs to know the language of the code block. This can be done in three different ways. via Markdown syntax recommended In Markdown, code blocks can be opened and closed by writing three backticks on separate lines. To add code highlighting to those blocks, the easiest way is to specify the language directly after the opening block. Example: ``` python import tensorflow as tf ``` Result: import tensorflow as tf via Shebang Alternatively, if the first line of a code block contains a shebang, the language is derived from the path referenced in the shebang. This will only work for code blocks that are indented using four spaces, not for those encapsulated in three backticks. Example: #!/usr/bin/python import tensorflow as tf Result: #!/usr/bin/python import tensorflow as tf via three colons If the first line starts with three colons followed by a language identifier, the first line is stripped. This will only work for code blocks that are indented using four spaces, not for those encapsulated in three backticks. Example: :::python import tensorflow as tf Result: :::python import tensorflow as tf Adding line numbers Line numbers can be added by enabling the linenums flag in your mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - codehilite(linenums=true) Example: ``` python \"\"\" Bubble sort \"\"\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Result: #!python \"\"\" Bubble sort \"\"\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] Highlighting specific lines Specific lines can be highlighted by passing the line numbers to the hl_lines argument placed right after the language identifier. Line counts start at 1. Example: ``` python hl_lines=\"3 4\" \"\"\" Bubble sort \"\"\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Result: #!python hl_lines=\"3 4\" \"\"\" Bubble sort \"\"\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] Supported languages excerpt CodeHilite uses Pygments , a generic syntax highlighter with support for over 300 languages , so the following list of examples is just an excerpt.

For this reason, the installation of this package is highly recommended as it's well-integrated with the Material theme. Installation The PyMdown Extensions package can be installed with the following command: pip install pymdown-extensions The following list of extensions that are part of the PyMdown Extensions package are recommended to be used together with the Material theme: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.arithmatex - pymdownx.betterem(smart_enable=all) - pymdownx.caret - pymdownx.critic - pymdownx.emoji : emoji_generator : !!python/name:pymdownx.emoji.to_svg - pymdownx.inlinehilite - pymdownx.magiclink - pymdownx.mark - pymdownx.smartsymbols - pymdownx.superfences - pymdownx.tasklist(custom_checkbox=true) - pymdownx.tilde Usage GitHub Flavored Markdown Most of the extensions included in the PyMdown Extensions package try to bring the Markdown experience closer to GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM). The PyMdown Extensions package adds a shorthand to enable all of the included extensions that provide the GFM experience. However, usage of the shorthand is discouraged, because some extensions are not supported, as the Material theme uses some incompatible extensions included in the standard Markdown library.

It auto-links http[s]:// and ftp:// links, as well as references to email addresses: SuperFences SuperFences provides the ability to nest code blocks under blockquotes, lists and other block elements, which the Fenced Code Blocks extension from the standard Markdown library doesn't parse correctly. Tasklist Tasklist adds support for styled checkbox lists. This is useful for keeping track of tasks and showing what has been done and has yet to be done. Checkbox lists are like regular lists, but prefixed with [ ] for empty or [x] for filled checkboxes. Example: * [x] Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit * [x] Nulla lobortis egestas semper * [x] Curabitur elit nibh, euismod et ullamcorper at, iaculis feugiat est * [ ] Vestibulum convallis sit amet nisi a tincidunt * [x] In hac habitasse platea dictumst * [x] In scelerisque nibh non dolor mollis congue sed et metus * [x] Sed egestas felis quis elit dapibus, ac aliquet turpis mattis * [ ] Praesent sed risus massa * [ ] Aenean pretium efficitur erat, donec pharetra, ligula non scelerisque * [ ] Nulla vel eros venenatis, imperdiet enim id, faucibus nisi Result: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit Nulla lobortis egestas semper Curabitur elit nibh, euismod et ullamcorper at, iaculis feugiat est Vestibulum convallis sit amet nisi a tincidunt In hac habitasse platea dictumst In scelerisque nibh non dolor mollis congue sed et metus Sed egestas felis quis elit dapibus, ac aliquet turpis mattis Praesent sed risus massa Aenean pretium efficitur erat, donec pharetra, ligula non scelerisque Nulla vel eros venenatis, imperdiet enim id, faucibus nisi Tilde Tilde provides an easy way to strike through cross out text. The portion of text that should be erased must be enclosed in two tildes ~~...~~ and the extension will take care of the rest. More syntactic sugar Caret Caret is the sister extension of Tilde and makes it possible to highlight inserted text . The portion of text that should be marked as added must be enclosed in two carets ^^...^^ . Mark Mark adds the ability to highlight text like it was marked with a yellow text marker . The portion of text that should be highlighted must be enclosed in two equal signs ==...== . SmartSymbols SmartSymbols converts markup for special characters into their corresponding symbols, e.g. arrows (\u2190, \u2192, \u2194), trademark and copyright symbols (\u00a9, \u2122, \u00ae) and fractions (\u00bd, \u00bc, ...). Critic Critic implements Critic Markup , a Markdown extension that enables the tracking of changes (additions, deletions and comments) on documents. During compilation of the Markdown document, changes can be rendered (default), accepted or rejected. Text can be deleted and replacement text added . This can also be combined into one a single operation. Highlighting is also possible and comments can be added inline . Formatting can also be applied to blocks, by putting the opening and closing tags on separate lines and adding new lines between the tags and the content. Arithmatex MathJax Arithmatex integrates Material with MathJax which parses block-style and inline equations written in TeX markup and outputs them in mathematical notation. See this thread for a short introduction and quick reference on how to write equations in TeX syntax. Besides activating the extension in the mkdocs.yml , the MathJax JavaScript runtime needs to be included. This must be done with additional JavaScript : extra_javascript : - 'https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML' If you want to override the default MathJax configuration, you can do this by adding another JavaScript file before the MathJax runtime in extra_javascript which contains your MathJax configuration, e.g.: window . MathJax = { tex2jax : { inlineMath : [ [ \"\\\\(\" , \"\\\\)\" ] ], displayMath : [ [ \"\\\\[\" , \"\\\\]\" ] ] }, TeX : { TagSide : \"right\" , TagIndent : \".8em\" , MultLineWidth : \"85%\" , equationNumbers : { autoNumber : \"AMS\" , }, unicode : { fonts : \"STIXGeneral,'Arial Unicode MS'\" } }, displayAlign : \"left\" , showProcessingMessages : false , messageStyle : \"none\" }; In your mkdocs.yml , include it with: extra_javascript : - 'javascripts/extra.js' - 'https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML' Blocks Blocks are enclosed in $$ ... $$ which are placed on separate lines. Example: $$ \\frac {n ! }{k !( n - k )! } = \\binom {n}{k} $$ Result: \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \\binom{n}{k} \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \\binom{n}{k} Inline Inline equations need to be enclosed in $ ... $ : Example: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet: $ p ( x|y ) = \\frac {p ( y|x ) p ( x ) }{p ( y ) } $ Result: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet: p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} InlineHilite InlineHilite adds support for inline code highlighting.

Under configuration folder you can find error.config.json file. Location : src/configurations/error.config.json The Concept of the error handler is to catch API error and handle it just by configuration. For example: when get devices api failed go to error page, or when submit order failed, display a popup with a message. The idea is to catch those error and decied what to do via just configuration file. Each time a API failed, the API will return some status code + error code from the API. <errorCode>_<statusCode> - Will be the key in the config file, and the value will be \"how we want to handle the error\".

The payload can be anything that we want to send to that component as props. @withErrorHandler In some cases when api failed, you want to display error only on specific component on the screen, and not some global component such modal etc .. For that case, you can use the decorator @withErrorHandler . @withErrorHandler get the following config: errorCodes - array of error codes from the error handler configuration file asComponent <optional> - by default set to false. if set to true, the decorator will not replace the component by default with error component, but it will inject for you to the props ErrorComponent , and you can decide by your self where to render this component.

Motivation redux-flow-manager created to help you manage application with complex flows. In the flow diagram below you can see example of one flow that can be in your application. In that flow diagram, each color is sub flow , and green and red steps are start and end flow. Redux Flow Manager help you to manage this sub flows and get decisions where you are and where you need to go. Install npm install --save redux-flow-manager Usage Check out the the example in the files app.ts and flowManger.browser.ts in the test folder . Step 1: Add the flow manager reducer to your project. import { combineReducers } from 'redux' ; import { flowManagerReducer } from 'redux-flow-manager' ; const rootReducer = combineReducers ({ flowManager : flowManagerReducer }); ... Step 2: Create Steps Configuration file - steps config define the set of steps for each sub flow types. (config files properties are explained below. Steps Configuration Step 3: Create Flows Configuration file - flow config file define the sub flow types name and the conditions that should be success to make this sub flow valid. (config files properties are explained below. Flows Configuration Step 4: Call CreateFlowManagerAPI with your store, reducer slice name, flows configuration and steps configuration.
